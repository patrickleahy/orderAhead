(1) Engineering exercise

- Task: Facebook Clone. Make a simple Facebook clone with basic
functionality.  You're free to use any framework you would like
(Rails, Django, etc...).  Deploy it on heroku (or any platform) and
send us either a link to GitHub or zip up the files and send them
over. Make sure to link us with any libraries
you are using. Here are the pages we'd like you to make:

1) Sign up page - A simple page for signing up - username, password, name.
2) Sign in page - A page for signing in, self explanatory
3) User profile page - A page for a user profile.  You should be able
to post links/notes/text on your own profile page, but other users'
pages should be read-only.  You should be able to "friend" other users
from this page (no "friend acceptance necessary", but it should be a
two-way relationship)
4) News feed page - Page for viewing your news feed - this should be
an aggregation of posts from all your friends.
5) Directory page - List of user pages, with links to their profiles.

Don't worry about styling too much - we're just looking for
functionality. Ruven (cced) is our Head of Product and can answer any
questions you have about the engineering exercise

(2) Creative exercise

- Please think of 3 ideas with the goal of acquiring new users that
demonstrate your creativity.
- Like all ideas we explore in Growth, your ideas should have
a shot at dramatically moving the needle.
- Please refer to publicly available information about OrderAhead
(orderaheadapp.com, app/android store) as you brainstorm.
